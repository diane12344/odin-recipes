<ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup butter</li>
    <li> 3 large eggs, room temperature</li>
    <li> red food coloring</li>
    <li> blue food coloring</li>
    <li>green food coloring</li>
    <li>yellow food coloring</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <p>Step1</p>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two 12-cup muffin pans with paper baking cups.</li>
    <p>step2</p>
    <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla in a separate bowl until evenly blended; set aside.</li>
    <p>step3</p>
    <li>Beat sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk mixture, mixing until just incorporated.</li>
    <p>step4</p>
    <li>Divide cake batter into four separate bowls. Add a few drops of food coloring into one bowl of batter and stir; add more food coloring if necessary to reach the desired shade. Repeat with remaining colors and bowls of batter.</li>
    <p>step5</p>
    <li>Using a different spoon for each color batter, spoon a small portion of each color into the cupcake liners, until 1/2 to 3/4 full. Do not mix the batter once it is in the cupcake liner.</li>
    <p>step6</p>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes clean, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
</ol>
